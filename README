Date::Extract - simple date extraction

There are already a few modules for getting a date out of a string.
DateTime::Format::Natural should be your first choice. There's also
Time::ParseDate which fits some very specific formats. Finally, you can
coerce Date::Manip to do your bidding.

But I needed something that will take an arbitrary block of text, search it
for something that looks like a date string, and build a DateTime object
out of it. This module fills this niche. By design it will produce few false
positives. This means it will not catch nearly everything that looks like a
date string.
